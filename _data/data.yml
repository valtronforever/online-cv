          data protection, information security and compliance with
          automation capabilities.\
          \
          **Interesting solutions:**\
          Create a service for working with third party data
          providers, like Azure, Google, AWS, Slack, etc. using FastAPI
          in async mode and OpenAPI code generation as SDK for this service.
          This approach allow to call some "fast" API actions directly from base system
          (without dealing any message brokers) and use celery for a "long" API calls.

          and label printers support, small mobile applications.\
          \
          **Interesting solutions:**\
          To have an ability to make an orders by multiple managers at same time without any collisions
          I decide to move order management system to dedicated service and rewrite it using Meteor and MongoDB.
          It's continue to use Django auth system, has simple implementation and allow users to see changes
          immediately.

        details: |
          Adverse media collect and search system.\
          \
          **Interesting solutions:**\
          Use Elasticsearch together with main Django db to store information about adverse media
          (more then 10 millions records of same type) and have quick fulltext search with hits highlighting.
          Also Elasticsearch supports horizontal scaling, which will be required in the future.

          Crm system development for working with clients,
          interested in binary options trading.\
          \
          **Interesting solutions:**\
          As our company priority was been a quick response on any client iterations
          we create a real time notification system using simple periodical GET requests from user browser.
          It's work for some time, but when company was grow we start to "spam" ourself by this notification requests.
          When I receive a task for optimising notification system, I write a simple NodeJS app with SocketIO library
          to use websockets (ant their replacement for old browsers).
          As result we was have something like Pusher but in 2013.
          

      - role: DB Administration and Data Analysis

          Administration Oracle DB. Writing PL/SQL programs.
          Creating tools for data export and visualization.\
          \
          **Interesting solutions:**\
          As our team was have a many requests from Statistics department (few for a day)
          to describe how particular number in report is calculated and why is not equal to
          similar in another report (as I remember we was have ~30 reports).
          Previously reports is was composed using Java and to answer we was need a 1-2 hour.
          In my solution I deside to write MS Excel template with macros in Basic
          (not usual solution for PL/SQL and Java developers). I put SQL conditions
          to hidden rows and cols opposite to result cels. As result we can see into report
          table and give an answer immediately.
